For example, apple, orange, banana etc. are examples of fruits or summer, winter etc, are examples of seasons so on and so forth. 

Etcetera can be used as a hack English language. The user of the word need not know or give many examples and can get away with giving just two examples. This allow users to talk about different things without knowing every component of it. It is one of the many arsenal used by school students when they have forgotten mostly about the topic.
